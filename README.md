### Hi there!

I am a Python developer. And I am really eager to became a perfect specialist! I've been learning python for a year. Now my stack is Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Unittest, SQL, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, Nginx, Yandex.Cloud (Ubuntu), Git.

Next I plan to learn the following: Flask, FastAPI, Asyncio, AsincAPI, Sanic etc. Maybe then I'll have a look on JavaScript.

And yes, I am open to work!
